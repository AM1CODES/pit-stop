The world of fantasy sports is awesome. With Pit Stop, we made it even better by integrating fantasy F1 with web3. Players can create their own car garage in the metaverse, mint F1 cars as NFTs, and wager them on real life F1 race drivers. They can then compete with other players by scoring points on the basis of results of real life F1 races which will make their cars more valuable, and move their garage up on the global leaderboard. Players can also buy/sell/trade these cars among each other, making their way to the top.
